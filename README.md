# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Model-to-Predict-the-Placement-Status-of-Student

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import the standard library in python.
2. Use drop(),isnull()functions to check the empty set and remove the given data.
3. Import labelencoder form sklearn use the lr for given featuers.
4. Import train_test_split .
5. Use the metrices for accuracy value.
6. Import the classification report .
7. Predict the value for unknown data.
 

## Program:
